# Golang Blockchain Network

This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain network using Golang. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology by building a basic blockchain from scratch.

## Features

- Block creation
- Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm
- Blockchain validation
- Peer-to-peer network

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Golang_blockchain.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Golang_blockchain
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the blockchain node:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
2. Interact with the blockchain through the provided API endpoints.

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: Entry point of the application
- `blockchain/`: Contains blockchain-related logic
- `network/`: Handles peer-to-peer network communication
